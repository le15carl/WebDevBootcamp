This is a project from the Udemy course Web Development Bootcamp called Score Keepeer. This webpage is a tool to keep score in a game.
The winner can chose what the winning score will be in the drop down menu. The default winning score is 3. The player can increment each
player's score by one with the player's respective button. These increment player score buttons become inactive once the winning score has been reached.
Once a player has won, the colors of the players scores wil change to reflect who is the winner. The number of the winner will turn green and the number
of the loser will turn red. The scores are able to be reset with the reset button. It is also important to notwe that when the winning score is selected,
the scores also reset. This prevents the winning score changing during a match.
